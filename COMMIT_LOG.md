used codex

- added this file (wow!!)
- sped up auth/page loads by caching firebase config + short session role cache
- auth is still checked server side for protected api stuff
- made page wipes way shorter/smoother and stopped duplicate nav triggers
- added hover/touch prefetching for internal pages
- added caching for shared css/js + firebase preconnects
- revamped dark mode contrast/surfaces/borders/placeholders without changing the main look
- cleaned up dark transition colors too
- checked python/js/html/css syntax, all good

unit tests couldnt run locally bc of the missing .env secrets which im assuming is on cloud run NICCCC, so i just committed to main branch cuz i didnt vastly change anything and we could always revert
